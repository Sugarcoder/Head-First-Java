CH 2 CLASSES & OBJECTS - NOTES


- When you design a class, think about the objects that will be created from that class type. 

Think about: 
- Things the object knows = instance variables (ex. ingredients)
- Things the object does = methods (ex. bake() )


- A class is a blueprint for an object. It tells the virtual machine how to make an object of that particular type. 


Example: 

class Dog {
	int size;             // instance variables
	String breed;
	String name;


	void bark() {                           // method
		System.out.println("Hi there!");
	}
}


class DogTestDrive {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Dog d = new Dog();                        // new Dog object
		d.size = 40;
		d.bark();
	}
}
