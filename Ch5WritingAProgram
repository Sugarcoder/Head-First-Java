CH 5 WRITING A PROGRAM: NOTES

- Pseudocode = half-way between real code and plain English description of the class. 

- Most prepcodes include 3 parts: instance variable declarations, method declarations, and method logic (most important, because it defines what has to happen).


--------Converting a String to an Int (get the int value of a String)---------

- Integer.ParseInt("3");    
// "3" takes a String, ParseInt is a method in the Integer class that knows how to "parse".


-------FOR LOOP--------

for (int cell : locationCells) { }
The colon : means 'in'. For each int value in locationCells

- Post-increment operator
numOfHits++;      // ++ means add 1 to whatever is there

- Break statement
break;           // Gets you out of a loop.


- Choose 'For' loops over 'while' loops when you know how many times you want to repeat the loop code. 


--------Regular 'for' loops (non-enhanced)---------

for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++);

// int i = 0; = initialization
// i < 100; = boolean test
// i++; = iteration expression


Difference between 'for' and 'while': 
- 'while' loop has only the boolean test. It doesn't have a built-in initialization or iteration expression. 
- 'while' loop is good when you don't know how many times to loop, and just want to keep going while some condition is true. 

Example: 
int i = 0; 
while (i < 100) {
	i++;
}


---------'For' loop (Enhanced)---------

Example: 
for (String name : nameArray) { // code to repeat goes here}

// String = the elements here in the array must be compatible with the declared variable type. 
// name = with each iteration, a different element in the array will be assigned to the variable "name".
// color: = means IN (name IN nameArray)
// nameArray = The collection of elements that you want to iterate over.


--------Explanations--------

- int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * 5);

// randomNum = an int variable to hold the random number we get back.
// (int) = This is a 'cast' and it forces the thing immediately after it to become the type of the cast. 
// Math.random = A class that comes with Java (random is the method that comes with the Math class).


.getUserInput("enter a number");
// A method of the GameHelper class that asks the user for command.


--------CASTING PRIMITIVES---------

- To force the compiler to jam the value of a bigger primitive variable into a smaller one, use the 'cast' operator.

Examples: 

long y = 30;
int x = (int) y;    // (int) is the 'cast'

float f = 3.14f; 
int x = (int) f;
