CH 12 GUI, EVENT HANDLING, INNER CLASSES: NOTES

- A listener interface is the bridge between the 'listener'(you) and the 'event source'(the button).

- Event source (like a button) = creates an event object when the user does something that matters (like click the button).


Example: 

If you implement MouseListener, you can get events for mousePressed, mouseReleased, mouseMoved, etc.

If you implement MouseListener, the mousePressed() method is called when the user presseds the mouse. When the user lets go, the mouseReleased() method is called. 


import javax.swing.*;

import java.awt.event.*;

public class SimpleGui1B implements ActionListener {
	JButton button;

	public static void main(String [] args) {
		SimpleGui1B gui = new SimpleGui1B();
		gui.go();
	}

	public void go() {
		JFrame frame = new JFrame();
		button = new JButton("Clicke me");

		button.addActionListener(this);       // Register your interest with the button (The argument you pass MUST be an object from a class that implements ActionListener)


		frame.getContentPane().add(button);
		frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		frame.setSize(300,300);
		frame.setVisible(true);
	}


	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {        // Implement the ActionListener interface's actionPerformed() method. This is the actual event-handling method!

		button.setText("I've been clicked!");

	}
}



- Listener (gets the event) = As the listener, my job is to 'implement' the interface, register with the button, and provide the event-handling. 


- Event source (sends the event) = As an event source, my job is to accept registrations (from listeners), get events from the user, and call the listener's event-handling method (when the user clicks me).


- Event object (holds data about the event) = As an event object, I'm the 'argument' to the event call-back method (from the interface) and my job is to carry data about the event back to the listener.  



-----------Inner Classes-------------

- An inner class can use all the methods and variables of the outer class, even the private ones. 

- The inner class gets to use those variables and methods just as if the methods and variables were declared within the inner class. 

- An inner class instance must be tied to an outer class instance. 


- If you instantiate an inner class from code within an outer class, the instance of the outer class is the one that the inner object will 'bond' with.

Example: 

class MyOuter {
	private int x;       // The outer class has a instance variable 'x'

	MyInner inner = new MyInner();   // Make an instance of the inner class

	public void doStuff() {
		inner.go();        // Call a method on the inner class
	}


	class MyInner {
		void go() {
			x = 42;      // The method in the inner class was the outer class instance variable 'x', as if 'x' belonged to the inner class. 
		}
	}  
}



----------Getting the two-button code to work (using Inner Classes)----------

public class TwoButtons {
	JFrame frame;
	JLabel label;

	public static void main (String[] args) {
		TwoButtons gui = new TwoButtons ();
		gui.go();
	}

	public void go() {
		frame = new JFrame();
		frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

		JButton labelButton = new JButton("Change label");
		labelButton.addActionListener(new LabelListener());      // Instead of passing (this) to the button's listener registration method, pass a new instance of the appropriate listener class.

		JButton colorButton = new JButton("Change Circle");
		colorButton.addActionListener(new ColorListner());

		label = new JLabel("I'm a label");
		MyDrawPanel drawPanel = new MyDrawPanel();


		frame.getContentPane().add(BorderLayout.SOUTH, colorButton);
		frame.getContentPane().add(BorderLayout.CENTER, drawPanel);
		frame.getContentPane().add(BorderLayout.EAST, labelButton);
		frame.getContentPane().add(BorderLayout.WEST, label);

		frame.setSize(300,300);
		frame.setVisible(true);

	}


	// Now, we get to have two ActionListeners in a single class!


	class LabelListener implements ActionListener {
		public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
			label.setText("Ouch!");
		}
	}

	class ColorListener implements ActionListener {
		public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
			frame.repaint();
		}
	}
}
