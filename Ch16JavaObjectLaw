------Java Object Law for HashCode() and equals()-----

- The API docs for classObject state the rules you must follow: 

1. If two objects are equal, they must have matching hashcodes. 

2. If two objects are equal, calling equals on either object must return true. (ex. if (a.equals(b), then (b.equals(a) )

3. If you override equals(), you must override hashCode().



- a.equals(b) must also mean a.hashCode() == b.hashCode()

- a.hashCode() == b.hashCode() does not have to mean a.equals(b)
